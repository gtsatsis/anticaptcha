## anticaptcha - A Go wrapper around the [Anti-Captcha](https://anti-captcha.com) API
This package provides a nice wrapper around the Anti-Captcha API, as the one present in their documentation is archived, and seems to no-longer be in active development.


### Documentation
This package is documented in GoDoc comments, and autogenerated documentation can be found at [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/gitlab.com/george/anticaptcha)

Additionally, an example is provided in the `examples/` directory.

### Development / Contributing
Development happens on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/george/anticaptcha).


I have made an attempt to support most Proxyless APIs that Anti-Captcha provides; I have no use for the ones that use custom proxies. MR's that introduce them are welcome, though.
